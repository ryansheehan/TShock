# TShock for Terraria

This is the rolling changelog for TShock for Terraria. Use past tense when adding new entries; sign your name off when you add or change something. This should primarily be things like user changes, not necessarily codebase changes unless it's really relevant or large.

## TShock 4.4.0 (Pre-release 8)
* Update for OTAPI 2.0.0.36 and Terraria 1.4.0.4. (@hakusaro, @Patrikkk, @DeathCradle)

  * `tshock.journey.setdifficulty`
  * `tshock.journey.biomespreadfreeze`
  * `tshock.journey.setspawnrate`
* Changed default thresholds for some changes in the config file to accommodate new items & changes to Terraria. (@hakusaro)

## TShock 4.4.0 (Pre-release 7 (Entangled))
* Fixed bed spawn issues when trying to remove spawn point in SSC. (@Olink)
* Fixed Snake Flute. (@Olink)
* Fixed lava absorbant sponge not capturing lava. `LiquidSetEventArgs` now returns a `LiquidType` instead of a byte type. (@hakusaro)
* Fixed bottomless lava bucket from not being able to create lava. (@hakusaro)
  * Ban a lava bucket to ban lava on the server entirely, until we figure out a better way to handle liquids.
* Fixed scarab bombs not detonating on pick style tiles. (@hakusaro)
* Fixed dirt bombs not creating dirt. (@hakusaro)
* Added a ridiculous amount of debug information. If you're experiencing any problems with 1.4 items being caught by the TShock anticheat system, please turn on DebugLogs in your config file and capture log data. It'll be extremely helpful in narrowing down precisely how to fix your problem. (@hakusaro)
* Released with entangled support for 1.4.0.4 based on @Patrikkk local build and latest snapshot gen-dev. (@hakusaro)


## TShock 4.4.0 (Pre-release 6)
* Updates to OTAPI 2.0.0.35 (@DeathCradle).

## TShock 4.4.0 (Pre-release 5)
* Update player spawn related things to 1.4. `Terraria.Player.Spawn` method now has a required argument, `PlayerSpawnContext context`. (@AxeelAnder)
* Make sqlite db path configurable. (@AxeelAnder)
* Terraria 1.4.0.3 experimental support. (@Patrikkk)
* Updated changelog. (@hakusaro)

## TShock 4.4.0 (Pre-release 4)
* Debug logging now provides ConsoleDebug and ILog has been updated to support the concept of debug logs. Debug logs are now controlled by `config.json` instead of by preprocessor debug flag. (@hakusaro)
* Removed `/confuse` command and Terraria player data resync from @Zidonuke. (@hakusaro)
* Attempted to fix the player desync issue by changing `LastNetPosition` logic and disabling a check in Bouncer that would normally reject player update packets from players. (@QuiCM, @hakusaro)

## TShock 4.4.0 (Pre-release 3)
* Fixed `/worldmode` command to correctly target world mode. (@Ristellise)
* The following commands have been removed: `tbloodmoon`, `invade`, `dropmeteor`. `fullmoon`, `sandstorm`, `rain`, `eclipse`
* The following command has been added to replace them: `worldevent`. This command requires the `tshock.world.events` permission.
  * `worldevent` can be used as so: `worldevent [event type] [sub type] [wave (if invasion event)]`
  * Valid event types are `meteor`, `fullmoon`, `bloodmoon`, `eclipse`, `invasion`, `sandstorm`, `rain`
  * Valid sub types are `goblins`, `snowmen`, `pirates`, `pumpkinmoon`, `frostmoon` for invasions, and `slime` for rain.

* A new set of permissions has been added under the node `tshock.world.events`:
  * `tshock.world.events.bloodmoon`: Enables access to the `worldevent bloodmoon` command
  * `tshock.world.events.fullmoon`: Enables access to the `worldevent fullmoon` command
  * `tshock.world.events.invasion`: Enables access to the `worldevent invasion` command
  * `tshock.world.events.eclipse`: Enables access to the `worldevent eclipse` command
  * `tshock.world.events.sandstorm`: Enables access to the `worldevent sandstorm` command
  * `tshock.world.events.rain`: Enables access to the `worldevent rain` command
  * `tshock.world.events.meteor`: Enables access to the `worldevent meteor` command

Please note that the permissions previously tied to the removed commands are also still used to confirm access to the new commands, so if you have existing configurations no one should have any new or lost access.

## TShock 4.4.0 (Pre-release 2)
* Replaced `/expert` with `/worldmode` command. (@QuiCM)
* Fixed NPC buff anticheat issue conflicting with Terraria gameplay changes (whips). (@Patrikkk)

## TShock 4.4.0 (Pre-release 1)
* Added confused debuff to Bouncer for confusion applied from Brain of Confusion
* API: Added return in OnNameCollision if hook has been handled. (@Patrikkk)
* API: Added hooks for item, projectile and tile bans (@deadsurgeon42)
* API: Changed `PlayerHooks` permission hook mechanisms to allow negation from hooks (@deadsurgeon42)
* API: New WorldGrassSpread hook which shold allow corruption/crimson/hallow creep config options to work (@DeathCradle)
* Fixed a missing case in UserManager exception handling, which caused a rather cryptic console error instead of the intended error message (@deadsurgeon42)
* Fixed saving when one player is one the server and another one joins (@MarioE)
* Fixed /spawnmob not spawning negative IDs (@MarioE)
* Validated tile placement on PlaceObject; clients can no longer place frames, paintings etc with dirt blocks (@bartico6, @ProfessorXZ)
* Updated to new stat tracking system with more data so we can actually make informed software decisions (Jordan Coulam)
* Fixed /time display at the end of Terraria hours (@koneko-nyan)
* Added a warning notifying users of the minimum memory required to run TShock (@bartico6)
* Added /group rename to allow changing group names (@ColinBohn, @ProfessorXZ)
* Added /region rename and OnRegionRenamed hook (@koneko-nyan, @deadsurgeon42)
* Rebuilt /ban add. New syntax is /ban add <target> [time] [reason] where target is the target online player, offline player, or IP; where time is the time format or 0 for permanent; and where [reason] is the reason. (@hakusaro)
* Removed /ban addip and /ban addtemp. Now covered under /ban add. (@hakusaro)
* Added /su, which temporarily elevates players with the tshock.su permission to super admin. In addition added, a new group, owner, that is suggested for new users to setup TShock with as opposed to superadmin. Finally, /su is implemented such that a 10 minute timeout will occur preventing people from just camping with it on. (@hakusaro)
* Added /sudo, which runs a command as the superadmin group. If a user fails to execute a command but can sudo, they'll be told that they can override the permission check with sudo. Much better than just telling them to run /su and then re-run the command. (@hakusaro)
* Fixed /savessc not bothering to save ssc data for people who bypass ssc. (@hakusaro)
* Default permission sets for new databases are more modern. (@hakusaro)

* Added DateTime datatype support for both MySQL and SQLite. (@Ryozuki)
* Fixed builds to not require a specific version of OTAPI and to not fail when in Release mode (@bartico6)
* Update Assembly Company to Pryaxis (@Ryozuki)
* Removed `/restart` command. (@hakusaro)
* Removed `Permissions.updateplugins` permission. (@hakusaro)
* Removed REST `/v3/server/restart/` route and `/server/restart/` route. (@hakusaro)
* The "auth system" is now referred to as the initial setup system (what it actually is). This is better verbiage for basically all situations. Who really wants to turn off the "authentication system?" In addition, the system now makes it more clear what the point of it is, rather than that it grants permissions. (@hakusaro)
* `GetDataHandlers.SendTileSquare` hook now sends a `TSPlayer` and a `MemoryStream` of raw data. (@hakusaro)
* Added `GetDataHandlers.HealOtherPlayer` hook. (@hakusaro)
* Added `GetDataHandlers.PlaceObject` hook. (@hakusaro)

* Added `TSPlayer` to `GetDataHandlers.NPCHome`. (@hakusaro)
* Added `TSPlayer` to `GetDataHandlers.ChestItemChanged`. (@hakusaro)
* Fixed chest item changes not triggering any range checks, tile checks, or correct chest checks. (@hakusaro)
* Added `TSPlayer` to `GetDataHandlers.PlayerBuff`. (@hakusaro)
* Added `TSPlayer` and `PlayerDeathReason` to `GetDataHandlers.PlayerDamage`. (@hakusaro)
* Added `TSPlayer` to `GetDataHandlers.NPCStrike`. (@hakusaro)
* Added `TSPlayer` to `GetDataHandlers.PlayerAnimation`. (@hakusaro)
* Added `GetDataHandlers.MassWireOperation` hook and related arguments. (@hakusaro)
* Added `GetDataHandlers.PlaceTileEntity` hook and related arguments. (@hakusaro)
* Added `TSPlayer` to `GetDataHandlers.GemLockToggle`. (@hakusaro)
* Added `GetDataHandlers.PlaceItemFrame` hook and related arguments. (@hakusaro)
* Added `TSPlayer.IsBouncerThrottled()`. (@hakusaro)
* Added `TSPlayer.IsBeingDisabled()` and removed `TShock.CheckIgnores(TSPlayer)`. (@hakusaro)
* Added `TSPlayer.CheckIgnores()` and removed `TShock.CheckIgnores(TSPlayer)`. (@hakusaro)

* All `GetDataHandlers` hooks now inherit from `GetDataHandledEventArgs` which includes a `TSPlayer` and a `MemoryStream` of raw data. (@hakusaro)
* Removed _all obsolete methods in TShock marked obsolete prior to this version (all of them)_ (@hakusaro).
* Removed broken noclip detection and attempted prevention. TShock wasn't doing a good job at stopping noclip. It's always worse to claim that you do something that you can't/don't do, so removing this is better than keeping broken detection in. (@hakusaro)
* Replaced `Utils.FindPlayer` with `TSPlayer.FindByNameOrID` to more appropriately be object orientated. (@hakusaro)
* Moved `Utils.Kick()` to `TSPlayer` since its first argument was a `TSPlayer` object. (@hakusaro)
* Removed `Utils.ForceKick()`. (@hakusaro)

### Using the Crash Reporter

TShock now has a crash reporter built in which writes crash logs to the `crashes` directory
in the event of a catastrophic failure.  **To change where TShock writes its crash logs,
specify the `-crashdir` parameter on the command line**.

1. In the event of a crash, look for a file called `crash_xxxx.zip` in the `crashes` directory
2. Upload the file somewhere, beware the crash file may be quite large (>100MB), anywhere like google drive, dropbox or mega will be fine
3. Post a link to the crash with reproduction steps in the TShock support forum

Alternatively, if you do not want to report the crash, just delete the file.
